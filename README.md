# diabetes_disease-_prediction-_model



 Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when blood glucose levels are too high. Early prediction can help in proper treatment and prevention.
This project demonstrates how data preprocessing, feature selection, and ML algorithms can be used to predict diabetes.
